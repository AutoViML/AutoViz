## Latest
The latest updates about `autoviz` library can be found in <a href="https://github.com/AutoViML/AutoViz/blob/master/updates.md">Updates page</a>.

## ImportantAnnouncement
### Starting with version 0.1.801, an important Update Regarding Dependency Management
We're excited to announce a significant update to AutoViz that enhances compatibility with various Python versions and streamlines dependency management!
<li>Modular Dependency Loading: AutoViz now uses a more flexible approach for importing visualization libraries starting with version `0.1.801`. This means you only need to install certain dependencies (like hvplot and holoviews) if you plan to use specific backends (e.g., bokeh). This change significantly reduces installation issues for users on newer Python versions such as 3.10 and higher.</li>

<li>Improved Backend Support: Depending on your Python environment, AutoViz dynamically adjusts to use compatible visualization libraries, ensuring a smoother user experience. Requirements:
        "holoviews>=1.14.9",
        "bokeh>=2.4.2",
        "hvplot>=0.7.3",
        "panel>=0.12.6".
</li>

### What Does This Mean for You?
<li>Easier Installation: If you've faced challenges installing AutoViz due to dependency conflicts, this update is for you. Now, you can install AutoViz without needing to install all its visualization dependencies upfront.</li>

<li>Tailored Usage: Choose the visualization backend that works best for your environment. AutoViz will handle the rest, importing necessary libraries as needed.</li>

<li>Seamless Compatibility: Users on the latest Python versions (like 3.11 and 3.12) can now enjoy a hassle-free AutoViz experience.</li>

### How to Update?
Simply pull the latest version of AutoViz (0.1.801 and higher) from the pip repository. The modular dependency system will be automatically applied.

## Motivation
The motivation behind the creation of AutoViz is to provide a more efficient, user-friendly, and automated approach to exploratory data analysis (EDA) through quick and easy data visualization plus data quality. The library is designed to help users understand patterns, trends, and relationships in the data by creating insightful visualizations with minimal effort. AutoViz is particularly useful for beginners in data analysis as it abstracts away the complexities of various plotting libraries and techniques. For experts, it provides another expert tool that they can use to provide inights into data that they may have missed.

</ol>
## Installation

**Prerequisites**
- [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

Create a new environment and install the required dependencies to clone AutoViz:

**From PyPi:**
```sh
cd <AutoViz_Destination>
git clone git@github.com:AutoViML/AutoViz.git
# or download and unzip https://github.com/AutoViML/AutoViz/archive/master.zip
conda create -n <your_env_name> python=3.7 anaconda
conda activate <your_env_name> # ON WINDOWS: `source activate <your_env_name>`
cd AutoViz
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Discover how to use AutoViz in this Medium article.

In the AutoViz directory, open a Jupyter Notebook or open a command palette (terminal) and use the following code to instantiate the AutoViz_Class. You can simply run this code step by step:

```python
from autoviz import AutoViz_Class
AV = AutoViz_Class()
dft = AV.AutoViz(filename)
```

AutoViz can use any input either filename (in CSV, txt, or JSON format) or a pandas dataframe. If you have a large dataset, you can set the `max_rows_analyzed` and `max_cols_analyzed` arguments to speed up the visualization by asking autoviz to sample your dataset.

AutoViz can also create charts in multiple  formats using the `chart_format` setting:
- If `chart_format ='png'` or `'svg'` or `'jpg'`: Matplotlib charts are plotted inline.
    * Can be saved locally (using `verbose=2` setting) or displayed (`verbose=1`) in Jupyter Notebooks.
    * This is the default behavior for AutoViz.
- If `chart_format='bokeh'`: Interactive Bokeh charts are plotted in Jupyter Notebooks.
- If `chart_format='server'`, dashboards will pop up for each kind of chart on your browser.
- If `chart_format='html'`, interactive Bokeh charts will be created and silently saved as HTML files under the `AutoViz_Plots` directory (under working folder) or any other directory that you specify using the `save_plot_dir` setting (during input).


## API
Arguments for `AV.AutoViz()` method:

- `filename`: Use an empty string ("") if there's no associated filename and you want to use a dataframe. In that case, using the `dfte` argument for the dataframe. Otherwise provide a filename and leave `dfte` argument with an empty string. Only one of them can be used.
- `sep`: File separator (comma, semi-colon, tab, or any column-separating value) if you use a filename above.
- `depVar`: Target variable in your dataset; set it as an empty string if not applicable.
- `dfte`: name of the pandas dataframe for plotting charts; leave it as empty string if using a filename.
- `header`: set the row number of the header row in your file (0 for the first row). Otherwise leave it as 0.
- `verbose`: 0 for minimal info and charts, 1 for more info and charts, or 2 for saving charts locally without display.
- `lowess`: Use regression lines for each pair of continuous variables against the target variable in small datasets; avoid using for large datasets (>100,000 rows).
- `chart_format`: 'svg', 'png', 'jpg', 'bokeh', 'server', or 'html' for displaying or saving charts in various formats, depending on the verbose option.
- `max_rows_analyzed`: Limit the max number of rows to use for visualization when dealing with very large datasets (millions of rows). A statistically valid sample will be used by autoviz. Default is 150000 rows.
- `max_cols_analyzed`: Limit the number of continuous variables to be analyzed. Defaul is 30 columns.
- `save_plot_dir`: Directory for saving plots. Default is None, which saves plots under the current directory in a subfolder named AutoViz_Plots. If the save_plot_dir doesn't exist, it will be created.

## Examples
Here are some examples to help you get started with AutoViz. If you need full jupyter notebooks with code samples they can be found in [examples](https://github.com/AutoViML/AutoViz/tree/master/Examples) folder.

### Example 1: Visualize a CSV file with a target variable

```python
from autoviz import AutoViz_Class
AV = AutoViz_Class()

filename = "your_file.csv"
target_variable = "your_target_variable"

dft = AV.AutoViz(
    filename,
    sep=",",
    depVar=target_variable,
    dfte=None,
    header=0,
    verbose=1,
    lowess=False,
    chart_format="svg",
    max_rows_analyzed=150000,
    max_cols_analyzed=30,
    save_plot_dir=None
)
```

### Example 2: Visualize a Pandas DataFrame without a target variable:

```python
import pandas as pd
from autoviz import AutoViz_Class

AV = AutoViz_Class()

data = {'col1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'col2': [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

dft = AV.AutoViz(
    "",
    sep=",",
    depVar="",
    dfte=df,
    header=0,
    verbose=1,
    lowess=False,
    chart_format="server",
    max_rows_analyzed=150000,
    max_cols_analyzed=30,
    save_plot_dir=None
)

```

### Example 3: Generate interactive Bokeh charts and save them as HTML files in a custom directory

```python
from autoviz import AutoViz_Class
AV = AutoViz_Class()

filename = "your_file.csv"
target_variable = "your_target_variable"
custom_plot_dir = "your_custom_plot_directory"

dft = AV.AutoViz(
    filename,
    sep=",",
    depVar=target_variable,
    dfte=None,
    header=0,
    verbose=2,
    lowess=False,
    chart_format="bokeh",
    max_rows_analyzed=150000,
    max_cols_analyzed=30,
    save_plot_dir=custom_plot_dir
)
```

## Tips
Here are some additional tips and reminders to help you make the most of the library:

- **Make sure to regularly upgrade AutoViz** to benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and improvements. You can update it using pip install --upgrade autoviz.
- **AutoViz is highly customizable, so don't hesitate to explore and experiment with various settings**, such as chart_format, verbose, and max_rows_analyzed. This will allow you to create visualizations that better suit your specific needs and preferences.
- **Remember to delete the AutoViz_Plots directory (or any custom directory you specified) periodically** if you used the verbose=2 option, as it can accumulate a large number of saved charts over time.
